# Air Quality Analysis and Visualization of Indian Cities 🇮🇳

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing air quality data across various Indian cities using Python and data visualization tools. The goal is to gain insights into pollutant levels, city-wise air quality trends, and identify pollution hotspots through meaningful charts and graphs.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze air quality trends across Indian states and cities
- Perform pollutant-wise and city-wise comparison
- Identify pollution hotspots
- Visualize temporal trends of pollutant levels
- Understand environmental impact and insights using data

## 📊 Graphs Included
1. **Bar Chart** – Top polluted cities based on average pollutant levels  
2. **Line Plot** – Pollutant trend over time in a selected city  
3. **Pie Chart** – Distribution of pollutants  
4. **Scatter Plot** – Relationship between pollution levels and station counts  
5. **Line Plot (Temporal Analysis)** – Monthly average pollution trend

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter/VS Code

## 🧼 Data Preprocessing
- Missing values handled using `fillna()` with mean or default replacement
- Dates converted to datetime format for temporal analysis

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure required libraries are installed:
